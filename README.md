THE SCOPE:
The main purpose of our analysis is to use bank data to predict the 
customers' behavior with respect to whether or not they will switch banks. To do this 
we implemented different types of supervised algorithms that were compared 
with each other based on their prediction accuracy. The interest in this type of research 
comes from the fact that they are an information requirement for banking institutions; in fact, 
they are often used to adopt customer retention strategies. 

THE DATASET AND EXPLORATIVE ANALYSIS (Source: Kaggle) 
The dataset presents 10,000 observations referring to customers from banks in three geographical areas 
(France, Germany, Spain), of which information was collected with respect to 14 variables. Of 
these we selected 11 of them because they were most relevant. mMore info on Kaggle.
